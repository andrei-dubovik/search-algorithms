The code for [my blog on search algorithms](https://dubovik.eu/blog/search-algorithms).

Prerequisites: GNU make, gcc. Run `make` to compile. The folder _release_ will have the executables for benchmarking running time and memory consumption, the folder _profile_ will have the executable for benchmarking visits (benchmarking visits comes with an overhead, hence separate executables).
